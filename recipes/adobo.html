    <h1>Filipino Chicken Adobo</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p> Chicken Adobo is a Filipno Classic and a personal comfort food. The combination of the sweet and fatty dark cuts of chicken contrasted by the sharper notes of vinegar pair deliciously.</p>
  <p> Put that over a warm, fluffy pile of white rice? Fahgettaboutit. And the best part??? The simpler it is == the more authentic it is.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Chicken Thigh (Bone in)</li>
    <li>Basil Leaf</li>
    <li>Black Peppercorn</li>
    <li>Vinegar</li>
    <li>Brown Suger (Rock sugar is better)</li>
    <li>Soy Sauce</li>
    <li>Chicken Stock</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Sear that chicken to lock in all that flavor, and coat the pan in little crispy bits of skin and fat.</li>
    <li>To the chicken, add 1/2 cup of vinegar, 1 cup of soy sauce, and 2 cups of chicken stock.</li>
    <li>Be sure to scrape the tasty bits that got cooked onto the pan loose.</li>
    <li>Add you brown/rock sugar and stir it until disolved into the sauce.</li>
    <li>Add your bay leaves and way too many black peppercorns (which for some reason aren't in a spice bag because that wouldn't make it Filipino.)</li>
    <li>Let it simmer and reduce, but not too much. You don't want all of those flavors to become more potent - just the good ones.</li>
    <li>Pour over your perfectly cooked white rice (because you measured with your knuckle).</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
