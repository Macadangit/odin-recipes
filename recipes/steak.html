    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> My ex might tell you I have comittment issues, but honestly she just cooked an awful steak.</p>
    <p> This dish somehow always seems to satisfy the caveman and sophisticated genleman within simultaneously.</p>
  
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Steak</li>
      <li>Rosemary</li>
      <li>Thyme</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
      <li>Flake Salt</li>
      <li>Garlif</li>
      <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>We're not reverse searing this baby. Get that cast iron skillet absolutely rippin after you pour your oil in, and then let that baby crackle.</li>
      <li>Don't touch it.</li>
      <li>Seriosuly. Don't.</li>
      <li>After 1.5 - 2 minutes (depending on the thickness of the steak) you should be good to check out that sear.</li>
      <li>Do the same thing to the other side.</li>
      <li>Take it off the heat and let it sit for a bit.</li>
      <li>Drop the butter (no such thing as too much) in the pan and let it melt into the steak juices.</li>
      <li>To your buttery, steaky soup, add your herbs and smashed cloves of garlic.</li> 
      <li>Keep the heat low so as to not burn your sauce of gold.</li>
      <li>Then, once its all nice and married, drop that steak back in there and baste like it's a fish out of water.</li>
      <li>After you've done that for what feels like too long and some, take it off and let rest.</li>   
      <li>Slice <em>with</em> the grain.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
