  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p> Char Siu Bao Buns are a Chinese dish. The steamed rice flour and wheat buns are filled with a sweet barbeque pork that's been marinated in the flavorful bright red sauce.</p>
  <p> While all individual parts of the char siu bao are important, the <strong>key</strong> to a good char siu bao lies in the ratio of filling to bun. No one likes flat buns :(</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Mix 1 cup of flour with 1.5 cups of water.</li>
    <li>Knead flower until a solid ball of dough is created.</li>

    <li>Slice char siu bao into small cubes.</li>
    <li>Cut dough-ball into smaller workable dough balls.</li>

  <h1>Filipino Chicken Adobo</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p> Chicken Adobo is a Filipno Classic and a personal comfort food. The combination of the sweet and fatty dark cuts of chicken contrasted by the sharper notes of vinegar pair deliciously.</p>
  <p> Put that over a warm, fluffy pile of white rice? Fahgettaboutit. And the best part??? The simpler it is == the more authentic it is.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Chicken Thigh (Bone in)</li>
    <li>Basil Leaf</li>
    <li>Black Peppercorn</li>
    <li>Vinegar</li>
    <li>Brown Suger (Rock sugar is better)</li>
    <li>Soy Sauce</li>
    <li>Chicken Stock</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Sear that chicken to lock in all that flavor, and coat the pan in little crispy bits of skin and fat.</li>
    <li>To the chicken, add 1/2 cup of vinegar, 1 cup of soy sauce, and 2 cups of chicken stock.</li>
    <li>Be sure to scrape the tasty bits that got cooked onto the pan loose.</li>
    <li>Add you brown/rock sugar and stir it until disolved into the sauce.</li>
    <li>Add your bay leaves and way too many black peppercorns (which for some reason aren't in a spice bag because that wouldn't make it Filipino.)</li>
    <li>Let it simmer and reduce, but not too much. You don't want all of those flavors to become more potent - just the good ones.</li>
    <li>Pour over your perfectly cooked white rice (because you measured with your knuckle).</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p> My ex might tell you I have comittment issues, but honestly she just cooked an awful steak.</p>
  <p> This dish somehow always seems to satisfy the caveman and sophisticated genleman within simultaneously.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Steak</li>
    <li>Rosemary</li>
    <li>Thyme</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Flake Salt</li>
    <li>Garlif</li>
    <li>Olive Oil</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>We're not reverse searing this baby. Get that cast iron skillet absolutely rippin after you pour your oil in, and then let that baby crackle.</li>
    <li>Don't touch it.</li>
    <li>Seriosuly. Don't.</li>
    <li>After 1.5 - 2 minutes (depending on the thickness of the steak) you should be good to check out that sear.</li>
    <li>Do the same thing to the other side.</li>
    <li>Take it off the heat and let it sit for a bit.</li>
    <li>Drop the butter (no such thing as too much) in the pan and let it melt into the steak juices.</li>
    <li>To your buttery, steaky soup, add your herbs and smashed cloves of garlic.</li> 
    <li>Keep the heat low so as to not burn your sauce of gold.</li>
    <li>Then, once its all nice and married, drop that steak back in there and baste like it's a fish out of water.</li>
    <li>After you've done that for what feels like too long and some, take it off and let rest.</li>   
    <li>Slice <em>with</em> the grain.</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
